# macOS on ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 7 / X1 Yoga Gen 4

## This fork is temporary

This is temporary while I put together a patch set to the parent repository. It exists to:

* bump to OpenCore 0.8.2
* suss out bugs in the X1Y4
* allow support for Monterey

## Original README follows:

OpenCore-based Hackintosh EFI and guide for Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 7 and X1 Yoga Gen 4. This guide has been generated for both the model numbers specified below.

# Usage
**This OpenCore config comes with empty PlatformInfo / SMBIOS!**

Follow **Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide** to generate your own: [**Laptop** Coffee Lake and Whiskey Lake > Platforminfo](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/coffee-lake.html#platforminfo). If you own a Lenovo 20R1 (Intel 10th gen) also note the hint at [Hardware Compatability](https://github.com/aidanchandra/x1c7-hackintosh#hardware-compatability)

# Overview
## Summary

This X1C7 Hackintosh project aims to be an all-in-one maintained hub for Opencore-based hackintoshes on the Thinkad X1 Carbon Gen 7. In short, this x1c7-hackintosh is very stable and is currently our daily driver (Simon and Aidan). We fully recommend this project to anyone looking for a MacBook alternative. There are also multiple contributors to this project who have all helped in various fashions - see credits.

This repo is meant to serve as a hub and guide for users of the X1C7 and X1Cx community in general.

<summary><strong> LIMITATIONS </strong></summary>
  
Limitations what is not working as expected or improvements:

 - **Bluetooth**: [General Limiations of IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://openintelwireless.github.io/IntelBluetoothFirmware/FAQ.html) + [Bluetooth Headsets No Mic #3](https://github.com/aidanchandra/x1c7-hackintosh/issues/3) 

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> Common Issues </strong></summary>
  
gioLockscreenState error is a common one working with uncommon iGPUs (like our UHD 620)
See issue #11 for solution

</details>

<br />

## Hardware Compatability
Lenovo allows for many different hardware configurations and will update CPU generations while maintaining the same generation. This makes is somewhat confusing to tell exactly what hardware you have and exactly what this project was meant for. The Shared Hardware tab lists all common hardware info between different models of the X1C7. Following tabs for specific model numbers provide small modificaitons needed to the EFI for their respective model numbers, if needed.

Odds are your hardware will work with minor modifications to the EFI

# Guide and Resources

There exists a plethora of much more detailed and well maintained guides using Opencore to get MacOS running on a PC. This guide will reference certian parts of those guides frequently for this reason. 


<details>
<summary><strong> Getting Started </strong></summary>

1. [Dortania's Guides](https://dortania.github.io/getting-started/) are the gold standard. We can safely ignore the hardware support function as those are for people who can choose their hardware - we can't with a laptop (yet).
</details> 

<details>
<summary><strong> Create USB Installer </strong></summary>

1. Create a MacOS Catalina Installer on an external USB drive using GibMacOS or using a reagular Mac and the app store. 
2. Mount
